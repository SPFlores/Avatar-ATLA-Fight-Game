Simple Javascript fighting game with an _Avatar: the Last Airbender_ theme. 

Choose your character and fight against the other 3 tribes to win. 

Player skill grows over time, enemy attack stays constant. Certain enemies are stronger than others and the player must be careful in choosing the order they fight the enemies in so they do not run out of health (no regen, except on reset).

Attack by pressing "attack" button once it appears. Reset can be achieved once the player has lost all life ("reset" button defaults to hidden at beginning). 

All playable characters have different attack levels, all characters have different enemy attack values. To win, each player must choose their enemies in a careful way. 

Thanks to Patrick "Dragon" B and "Royal" Rey G for testing, playing, and generally supporting me while I struggled through this. 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30098942/javascript-set-all-values-in-array-of-object thread used as a starting point to figure out how to reset enemy array values (there's probably an easier way to do it, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ it finally works and after almost 6 hours over 2 days that's all I care about). All other code should be original.
